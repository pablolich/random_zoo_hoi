1. Write efficient code
2. Figure out how to go from HOI RE to HOI GLV in a systematic way
3. run 1000 simulations with d = 2,3,4,5,6 and n = 2,4,8,16 on the cluster

1. Find roots in mathematica too, in order to check that our results are correct
2. Find a way to prove random zoo with three-way interactions. Understand Carlos's proof
3. Numerically get all real equilibria, multiply by all possible D's, and see what is the probability of feasibility
