1. Write efficient code
2. Figure out how to go from HOI RE to HOI GLV in a systematic way
3. run 1000 simulations with d = 2,3,4,5,6 and n = 2,4,8,16 on the cluster

1. Find roots in mathematica too, in order to check that our results are correct
2. Find a way to prove random zoo with three-way interactions. Understand Carlos's proof
3. Numerically get all real equilibria, multiply by all possible D's, and see what is the probability of feasibility

test if my results change with symmetric tensor slices.
Test for dimension 2, different variances
build output name outomatically

Compare results with d = 2 to see the increase, and base research in known fact(s (1/2^n)
Check variance also converges to the theoretical formula
Put errorbars in simulations
Do the same for Uniform distribution
Write down a way go from RE to GLV for arbitrarily high order interactions

Show that GLV with HOIs is a random polynomial
Compute probability of feasibility
