- What is going on with all the zeros there?
- Check kss_polynomials folder
- Check symmetric_case folder
- Merge all good simulations in the merging directory
- Check if merged simulations reduce the gap
- Check if the old simulations still work to run fast more of these
- Implement specific n and d input
- Run more simulations of the old ones for specific n, and ds to fill in simulations I am missing
- Minimize using the variance
- Check asymptotic formula, AGAIN
- Write down Chebyshev proof
- Make plots of variances of coefficients
- Consider if/where to put plots of histograms of roots, and how to create them in latex
- Can we run julia in the cluster?  
- Why do I not get the more feasibility as increasing number of resources type of behaviour?
- Comment latex code
- Calculate variance of the coefficients of GLV based on experiments
- Explain the 1/2^n that seems to be obvious to mathematicians
- Check that variance converges to the theoretical formula
