- Plot latex to see if they get closer to the triangles
- If yes, run simulations for big guns with merge = true
- Address alex comments
- Run simulations dropping assumptions
- save numbers as integers in julia, they weight less
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Check asymptotic formula, AGAIN
- Write down Chebyshev proof
- Write down proof of parity under anty-symmetric case
- Make plots of variances of coefficients
- Consider if/where to put plots of histograms of roots, and how to create them in latex. Maybe in a section called: Simulation protocol and results
- Can we run julia in the cluster?  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Investigate other models
- Why do I not get the more feasibility as increasing number of resources type of behaviour?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Comment latex code
- Calculate variance of the coefficients of GLV based on experiments
- Explain the 1/2^n that seems to be obvious to mathematicians should we email duong?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Write paper introduction
