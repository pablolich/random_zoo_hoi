- Check that my check_kss_variance files behave like expected.
- Run symmetric case.
- Fix antisymmetric case
- Merge all good simulations in the merging directory
- Check if merged simulations reduce the gap
- Check if the old simulations still work
- Implement specific n and d input
- Run more simulations of the old ones for specific n, and ds to fill in simulations I am missing
- Can we run julia in the cluster?  
- Why do I not get the more feasibility as increasing number of resources type of behaviour?
- Comment latex code
- Calculate variance of the coefficients of GLV based on experiments
- Explain the 1/2^n that seems to be obvious to mathematicians
- Check that variance converges to the theoretical formula
- Find a way to convert r, A, B, ... to a polynomial in julia
