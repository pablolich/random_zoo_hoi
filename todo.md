#MAIN PRIORITY

- test latest additions to cluster code
- Write code to save equilibria and stability for each d, n
- cr with functional response
- Run simulations dropping assumptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#SECONDARY PRIORITY

- Check asymptotic formula, AGAIN
- Write down Chebyshev proof
- Consider if/where to put plots of histograms of roots, and how to create them in latex. Maybe in a section called: Simulation protocol and results
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#BACKGROUND NOISE

- Should I look at what is the profile of the steady state abundances?
- Save data on stability?
- Comment latex code
- Explain the 1/2^n that seems to be obvious to mathematicians should we email duong?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#QUESTIONS

- Write paper introduction
- Bring back the sparsity assumption?
