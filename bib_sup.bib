abstract={Rich ecosystems harbour thousands of species interacting in tangled networks encompassing predation, mutualism and competition. Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

abstract="In the study of algebraic and numerical properties of polynomials one occasionally introduces the notion of a random polynomial. For example, this chapter was originally motivated by investigations, including [Ki, Re, SS, Sml, Sm2], into the complexity of root-finding algorithms for polynomials. We restrict our attention to central normal measures on spaces of polynomials, i.e., we assume that the coefficients of the polynomials have a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and known covariance.",
